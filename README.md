# Hi, I'm Konstantin

I'm writing software professionally since 2005, and managing teams since 2012. I did a lot of interesting things during my journey, including working on an RTOS kernel, infrastructure at Parallels, and building cluster tooling for an in-memory database.

Around 2016 I realized that I'm interested in self-discovery and helping other people. That's why I started studying Gestalt Therapy and CBT.
